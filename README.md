remarks about sum-even

This Assembly program calculates the sum and count of even numbers from the array [2, 3, 4, 5]. It checks each number using the test instruction to see if it is even, adds even numbers to a sum variable, and increments a counter. Finally, it outputs the sum and count of even numbers using Irvine32 functions.




remarks about sum-odd

This Assembly program calculates the sum and count of odd numbers from the array [2, 3, 4, 5]. It checks if each number is odd using the test instruction, adds odd numbers to the sum, and increments the count. Finally, it displays the sum and count using Irvine32 functions


remarks about sum-pos
This Assembly program calculates the sum and count of positive numbers from the array [-3, 6, 1, 10, -1, 30, -40, -4]. It checks each number to see if it is positive, adds positive numbers to the sum, and increments the count. The sum and count are then displayed using Irvine32 functions


Overall remarks
we use loops and jumps in this
